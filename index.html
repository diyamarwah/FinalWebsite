        <figcaption>The navigation header is explained in the above image.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
				<img src="cs2.png"/>
        <figcaption>The "Home Page" is the content that a user will first see. Hence it is important to emphasise through visuals what work the charity is doing. </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
				<img src="cs3.png"/>
        <figcaption>Donation is the most important part of the page as it is the force that fuels the charity </figcaption>
      </figure>
      

      <figure>
				<img src="cs4.png"/>
        <figcaption>The live flight map is a good method to convince wary users of the authenticity of CareFlight and its operations. It also provides a medium of interactivity with the user. </figcaption>
      </figure>
			
      <figure>
				<img src="cs5.png"/>
        <figcaption>The timeline introduces a fun, visual way to introduce the history of the charity as the connotation of the title may bore some users if not represented properly.</figcaption>
      </figure>
			
      <figure>
				<img src="cs6.png"/>
        <figcaption>Links to media stories are important so that people can view how careFlight positively impacts people in need of aid. However, instead of plain text links, image links add substance to the webpage.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
				<img src="cs7.png"/>
        <figcaption>The donation page being the most important is also very simple, as it ensures that potential contributors face minimal difficulty while attempting to donate.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
				<img src="cs8.png"/>
        <figcaption>The emergency page helps individuals who are seeking help from CareFlight or other emergency services.Red indicating urgency, helps them realise they have arrived at the right page.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
				<img src="cs9.png"/>
        <figcaption>The footer may not contribute to interactive content, but contains essential information that needs to be made available to the public.</figcaption>

			<h2>Further Design Elements </h2>
      <p> In the entirety of the website, there is a common theme of a blue and yellow pallette. This is in tandem with the colours of the logo. Like any other business, charities also have contemporaries that may do a similar task that they undertake. </p>

      <p> With a constant colour theme, the brand is reflected so people remember careFlight and the work it does and can most importantly recognise it in any situation.</p>

    <p> The "Poppins" font used helped convey a relaxed website with no trappings of a conventional, formal and old school typography.</p>
